# Employee Attrition Prediction (ANN)

## 🧠 Overview: 
This project predicts whether an employee will stay or leave a company based on HR-related data using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
## 🎯 Objective:
Predict employee attrition (Yes/No) to help HR take preventive actions and improve retention.
## 🧰 Tools / Libraries:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
## 🧾 Dataset:
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (Kaggle). Features include Age, Department, JobRole, MonthlyIncome, Overtime, YearsAtCompany.

## Employee Attrition Prediction app, built with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and deployed on Streamlit.
This isn't just a prediction model; it’s a strategic HR tool that delivers two critical features:
## High-Accuracy Prediction: 
The ANN processes complex employee data to deliver reliable forecasts of who is likely to leave.
## Explainability (SHAP):
I integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to show exactly why an employee is flagged as high-risk, moving beyond "what" and into "why." This is crucial for targeted retention efforts!

The app features an interactive dashboard with powerful filtering and analytics (as seen in the attached video).
